The letter this month is a companion to the letter from Richard senior last month, and was written to
George on the same day.

Richard describes his trip to the Cotswolds and his purchase pf fells, although his total his 500 less
than the one his father gave, at 2,500. He also gives the prices paid, with £3 per 100 for 1,500 and
£3 40d per 100 for the remaining 1,000. From this, and given that the total Richard is paying is £80,
the carriage cost £3 4s.

For the payments, we see the typical three installment pattern, with Richard paying £40 at the time,
£20 at Bartholomew’s-tide, and a final £20 at Hallow’s-tide. Hallow’s-tide is the one we are still
familiar with, neing All Hallow’s day, 1 st November, and for which is embedded in modern culture
for 31 st October as All Hallow’s Eve, or colloquially, Halloween.

Bartholomew’s day is the 24 th August, and is probably less familiar to most. However, it is infamous
for the Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in Paris, France in 1572, a massacre of Huguenots by Roman
Catholics. Post-period it was also the day in 1662 when 2,000 protestant priests in England were
ejected from their posts for denying the authoristy of the Established Church.

Richard also relates the receipt of a letter from their brother Robert, containing a bill of payment for
£4. It’s worth reiterating that at this time the poiund was not an actual unit of currency as a coin. As
such payments of this size would require redeeming a bill of payment with someone at a given date
for real currency. Richard does however comment, ‘I pray God send us good payment’. Despite, or
perhaps because of, being the eldest brother, Robert was by far the least responsible. He had a
history of financial and social misdemeanours which had caused the family numerous headaches.
Amongst these issues were his bills not always being worth the paper they were written on.

The final aspect worth drawing out is the update on George’s horses. Throughout these letters,
George appears to be attempting to sell horses back in England without much apparent success,
matbe because he wasn’t able to drive it himself. We learn that currently George has a black and a
gray, no one has bid on them, and that their upkeep is costing him a fair bit.

### Modernization

Of Jesus 1480

Right eternally wellbeloved and my singular good brother, I recommend myself unto you in
as loving-wise as a heart can think. Be pleased to understand that at the writing of this, our
father and mother, my godfather Marton, and we all were at London in good health, thanks
be to the good Lord. Sir, I have been in the Cotswolds and bought for us 2,500 fells, priced
per 100 at £3 for 1,500 and £3 3s 4d for every 100 for 1,000, and I have paid and within
these 5 days, inpart payment of these fells, and for carriage, £40 and above, and I must
pay to Wylliam Mydwynter at Bartholomew’s-tide £20, and at {All] Hallow’s-tide £20 for the
said fells. Sir, I pray you have these days in remembrance that my poor honesty
[reputation] lies thereupon, and at my coming out of the Cotswolds upon a short visit, our
father has shipped 27 sarplers of his wool that was packed at Northleach since Easter, and
there are 6 of them are middle, and that is all the middle wool of that sort. I know it well,
that there comes no better middle wool from our father these 7 years; and at the next
shipping our father will ship the remainder of good wool of this sort, and all his fells, and so
will I ours, and I have received 2 letters from you, obe from our brother Robarde, and
therein was, by his own hand, contained £4 sterling payable the 4 th day of &lt;blank&gt;, I pray
God send us good payment, and another [from] Edwhard Lenawllys the which I do well
understand. I intend, by the grace of God, to be at Lontelay’s wedding on Sunday next,
and my godfather too. Sir, your black horse is here, and your grey, at London. They are ib
good health. No man has bid any money for them, and they stand you to great cost daily.
As for horses and hawks, I intend to never have past one at once. Sir, I understand bu
your writing that you have levied Thomas Graynger to be your attorney at Calais while you
go to the marte. I send him a letter and therein the ships’ names and the weight of our
father’s and number that he shall receive by it. May the grace of Jesus have you in his
blessed keeping. Written at London, the second day of June.

By your brother  
Rychard Cely.

_Addressed:_ Unto my right wellbeloved brother George Cely, merchant of the Staple at
Calais, or at the marte, be this delivered.
