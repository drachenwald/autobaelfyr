Important Message for all Yule Ball 2023 Attendees

Greetings from Eularia Trewe, Yule Ball Reservations Steward - please read carefully for updated Yule Ball information . . .

MEMBERSHIP STATUS FOR ALL ATTENDEES **REQUIRED:**

Insulae Draconis has new liability insurance requiring current membership information to comply. Consequently, all Yule Ball attendees will shortly receive an email from [reservations@flintheath.org.uk](reservations@flintheath.org.uk) containing a link to a short form to submit your membership information. Please keep an eye out for this in your inbox. The deadline for submitting this information is **15 November**. Failure to provide the information will exclude you from coverage and _your reservation will be forfeit_.

PAYMENT REMINDER:

All fees must be paid by 15 November, or _your reservation will be forfeit_.

RESERVATIONS CLOSE 15 NOVEMBER:

As a provision of our new insurance, attendee membership information must be submitted to our insurer in advance of the event. Therefore, we cannot accommodate walk-ins. Only attendees who have submitted their membership information and paid their balance due by **15 November** will be allowed on-site.

COVID PRECAUTIONS:

The virus is still with us. To protect each other from infection and keep the event Covid-free, we are taking common-sense precautions against the spread of the virus. Please take a Covid test within 24 hours before arrival. If you test positive or if you are feeling unwell, please stay home and take care of yourself (arrangements for a refund will be made). Attendees are requested to wear a mask when checking-in.

RAIL SERVICE DISRUPTION:

Please note there is no rail service at Huntingdon and limited service at St Neots on Sunday, 3 December. For more information, visit: [https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/engineering-works/potters-bar-20231203/](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/engineering-works/potters-bar-20231203/)

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this message. I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is that all Yule Ball attendees submit their membership information - without it, we are not covered by insurance and cannot have the event. Sorry about the extra hassle, but itâ€™s worth it.

YIS, Eularia Trewe  
Yule Ball Reservations Steward
