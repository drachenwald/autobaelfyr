Greetings from the rolling hills of Cambridge (well the locals claim one or two as hills, though I have my
doubts).

August sure has been busy across the Isles! Multiple gatherings here and overseas dominated the last
month, earning glory across the activities and disciplines of the Principality.

It’s certainly not been dull for the Seneschallate, as we are grappling with the after-effects of the
insurance changeover. I am really sorry for the problems this is causing while we navigate the turmoil of
the Irish insurance market. Reading around the subject I remain hopeful that we can settle things down,
and my office remains at hand in order to help things along.

**Call for bids – Coronet August 2024 + Long Summer event**

Ormthing has been and gone, and from accounts, was by and large well-received with lots of archery,
equestrian, combat and other activities all round. There are still a few details to iron out post-Raglan
era, but the next team will have to hand tips, tricks and Principality support to run next year’s event. I
am keen to see longer-term planning and advertising of events as this means members can book leave
with a greater chance of getting their desired dates, as well as booking into a better quality of venues
without scrabbling for dates.

Due to the calendar of reigns, the Tourney after Eplaheimr’s Coronet in November coincides with our
Long Event period. This did happen with Raglan events and allowed for a more regal approach to the
normal compact weekend. Happy to discuss further with interested branches and potential event teams.

Best,  
Guy
