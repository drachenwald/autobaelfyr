Greetings Insulae Draconis!

As expected August has proved full of action and crowded with incident. 

If you corner His Highness when next you see him, he will happily regale you with tales from Pennsic, stories of the glory of the Rapier Woods Battle, the tragedy of The Missing Luggage (never fear, it was eventually found), and many more.

Ormþing followed hot on the heels of Pennsic. The week began with splendid equestrian activities, with five riders and four horses.  Lady Elisabeth Hardyng was triumphant in the Protector competition, and her horse Rocky was victorious in the Equus Bellator tournament, while Phil of Flintheath was named Equestrian Champion.
