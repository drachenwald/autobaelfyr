_or **What kind of monster creates a quiz with 29 questions?**_

The quiz was created with 6 sections of 6 points each, based on SCA and mundane
history for each of the territories covered by the Knowne World (the entire planet),
Drachenwald (Europe and Africa) and Insulae Draconis, with an extra half round
based on Bourn, as Lady Rebecca of Flintheath has posted on its history.

I’ve divided the answers from the questions, so that anyone who wants to can run
through the quiz before looking at the answers if they want to.

## Answers

### Knowne World History and Culture

1) 1st May 1966 (1) at Berkley, California (1).  

It is for this reason that the beginning of the Year of the Society (Anno Societatis, AS) is the
1 st of May. As with most dating systems, there is no year zero, so we are currently in AS58.

2) 16

There are 20 kingdoms in total, of which 16 contain the letter ‘a’ in their name.

3) Meridies, Middle, Northshield and West

The Middle is often colloquially known as the Midrealm, but that isn’t the official name.

4) Generically: Laurel Sovereign of Arms

Currently: Laurel Queen of Arms. The post is occupied by Magistra Emma de Fetherstan.

### Drachenwald History and Culture

1. West (1966)
1. East (1968)
1. Middle (1969)
1. Atenveldt (1971)
1. Meridies (1978)

6) East

7) West

Drachenwald’s first king was King Elffin, now commonly known as Duke Drachenwald, and
he is originally from what is now the Kingdom of Lochac. However, at the time that
Drachenwald was founded, in 1993, Lochac was still only a Principality of the West Kingdom.

8) The Fellowship or Guild of Albion of the Mystery of the Armourers of the Kingdom of
Drachenwald (only half a point for Armourers Guild).

This name was based on that of the London Armourers Guild, founded in 1453 as The
Fraternity or Guild of St. George of the Men of the Mystery of Armourers of our City of
London. The arms of the Drachenwald Guild (registered as a badge because rules) are
similarly based upon the London guild.

9) Morgan (0.5) and Alienor (0.5).

They reigned as 23rd Prince and Princess in 1991 and the 2 nd King and Queen in 1994.

### Insulae Draconis History and Culture

10) Michael de Brad (1) &amp; Alessandra Melusine (1)

Viceroys and Vicereines reign as the rulers of Crown Principalities. Insulae Draconis was a
Crown Principality from 2003 until 2010.

11) The Order of Robin (1)

Robin Bowman (0.5) of Dalriada (0.5)

The order is for courtesy and chivalry. The latest recipient is Lord Alex of Long Riston, who
received it on the field during his Dawn Company challenge at Ormþing.

12) 2021

Insulae Draconis was originally founded just in Britain, and hence on a single island, as Insula
Draconis, and was registered as such. The name was handed off to the Crown Principality,
which at that point covered multiple islands (Insulae being the plural of Insula in Latin).
However, despite this, and a poll conducted in 2005 to formalise and register the change, it
never actually happened. This name change was finally formally registered in 2021. Given
there was a documentable poll in the past, and that all documentation since that time has
referred to Insulae Draconis, we were able to get a dispensation from holding the poll again.

The name translated as The Islands of the Dragon. Colloquially it is often just called the
Dragon Isles.

13) Master Paul de Gorey

Paul de Gorey was elevated to the Order of the Laurel in 1996 and reigned as King in 2012.
One of his favourite classes was on the English Longsword and he seemed to thoroughly
enjoy how obscure the text was. A commonality was trying to work out what moves the
various names referred to, one being the rabbit. Unfortunately, Paul died suddenly earlier
this year, a loss of an always cheerful and knowledgeable friend.

### Global History

14) Yuan Dynasty (1)

There were actually two attempts, the first in 1274 and the second in 1281. (2 points for
either date and 1 if otherwise in the range of 1264-1291. Bonus point for knowing there
were two attempts and add your points if you gave two dates. Total of 5 if you knew there
were two invasions and got both years right.)

The invasion of 1281 is perhaps the more famous as it ended when the Mongol fleet was
devastated by a typhoon, named ‘the Divine Wind’, or in Japanese ‘Kamikaze’. The same
name, in English, was given to the storm that also devastated the Spanish Armada in 1588.

15) Gupta Empire

The Gupta dynasty was founded sometime in the late 3 rd century and reaching its zenith in
the early and mid-4 th century. Much like the Western Roman Empire, its collapse wasn’t
sudden, but a decline and shrinkage, before finally disappearing in about 550.

16) The Sassanian Empire (1) was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate (1), finally being
defeated in 651.

This was only 40 years after the first revelations to Mohammad who had died in 632.
Conversion was not particularly rapid with many living as non-Muslims under the new
regime. The Sassanian Empire was predominately Zoroastrian, but also had Christian, Jewish,
Hindu and Buddhist communities.

In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate morphed into the Umayyad Caliphate, as the result of
assassinations.

### History in Drachenwald

17) Ethiopia (1) and Kongo (1) to at least Portugal and the Vatican.

Both these kingdoms dominated their respective zones of the African continent, The
Kingdom of Ethiopia has a much longer history as a distinct political entity, dating back to
antiquity and adopting the name Ethiopia in the mid-4 th century.

18) The Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The combined state was ruled by a king who was both the King of Poland and the Grand
Duke of Lithuania, established by the marriage of Polish Queen Jadwiga to Lithuanian Grand
Duke Jogaila. The kingdom became The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. The
Commonwealth was dismantled by the Third Partition of 1795.

Lithuania was still pagan at the time of the marriage, but Jogaila converted, at first glance
surprisingly, to Roman Catholicism for the marriage, instead of the more local Orthodox
Christianity. However, at the time Lithuania was a target of a crusade by the Teutonic
Knights, who regarded Orthodoxy as little different from paganism. In the end this didn’t
make much difference as the Teutonic Knights claimed the conversion was a sham and they
continued their attacks until a treaty was finally concluded in 1398.

19) The Plague of Justinian / Justinian Plague (1) of 541-549 (531-559)

The Justinian plague was bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis and was the first
historically recorded pandemic of this disease. The outbreak affected the Near East, the
Mediterranean and Europe as whole, impacting both the Persian Sassanian Empire and the
Byzantine Empire of Justinian. Justinian himself caught the plague in 542 and recovered, but
about one fifth of the population of Constantinople was killed.

Yersinia pestis is the same bacterium that cause the Black Death almost exactly 800 years
later in the period 1346-1353, hitting Insulae Draconis in 1348.

Plague still circulates, with recent cases appearing in China. However, being a bacteria, it is
easily treated with anti-biotics, and so far, hasn’t developed resistance.

20) Poitiers

The Umayyad Caliphate invaded Spain in 711. All of Spain at some point was under Islamic
control although Galicia in the extreme northwest was only held for 28 years, whereas
Granada was held for 781 years until the Reconquista was completed in 1492. Over the next
120 years about 3 million Muslims then emigrated to North Africa, either voluntarily, or later
forcibly expelled.

The initial Umayyad invasion of what is now France began only 8 years after entering Spain
in 719, crossing the Pyrenees into the last remnant of the Visigoth kingdom. This advance
was stopped at Toulouse in 721. The Caliphate attempted to expand into Aquitaine, then still
independent from the Franks, led by Duke Odo, and who managed to hold off both powers.
After a major raid by the Caliphate on Tours was defeated, the Battle of Poitiers saw the end
of Islamic expansion, although with Odo’s death in 735, Aquitaine succumbed to the Franks
under Charlemagne. After an abortive attempt to expand into Provence in 734 the Caliphate
was left with just its initial conquest of Septimania. In 752, the newly crowned Pepin
initiated a new assault and won a final victory at Narbonne in 759.

Pepin’s son, Charlemagne, pushed across the Pyrenees to create a buffer zone called the
Spanish March between the Caliphate and Francia proper. This became a focus for the
subsequent Spanish Reconquista.

### History in Insulae Draconis

21) Æthelstan (1), son of Edward the Elder, grandson of Alfred the Great, from 927

Whilst Alfred is commonly credited with creating the idea of England and the English as a
single identity for the Anglo-Saxons, he didn’t achieve the goal himself, although he did
leave Wessex much stronger and in effective, but not direct, control of West Mercia, the
east being held by the Danes. Alfred only ever described himself as King of the English not
ruled by the Danes.

Edward brought all of Mercia under his direct control and added East Anglia.

Æthelstan came to the throne in 924. Three years later Æthelstan took Northumbria and was
acknowledged King of the English, by his neighbours, including King Constantine of Scotland,
who also had claims on Northumbria.

22) Iceland was settled.

Despite surviving stories, there is little reliable evidence about the settlement, and indeed
there is a possibility that there was already an Irish monastic community there for perhaps
two hundred years.

However, the major settlement of lasting influence was that by the Norse, most likely
because after running out of land in Scandinavia, and with Ireland and Britain already
occupied or unsuccessfully attacked, Iceland was pretty much the only place left.

It seems unlikely to me that anyone else cared that much at the time and may well have
thought the entire endeavour foolhardy if they did notice. However, Iceland has survived to
the modern day and prospers despite not being an obvious place to live. It is also the
location of the Shire of Klakavirki.

23) Matilda.

These events happened during the period of English history known as The Anarchy, When
the Empress Matilda contested with King Stephen for the throne of England. Matilda was
the daughter of Henry I, and was named as his successor and sworn as such by his barons.
This was necessary as the sole male heir, William, was killed in the sinking of the White Ship
in 1120. However, Matilda suffered three major disadvantages: she was a woman, she was
married to Geoffrey of Anjou, traditionally viewed as an enemy, and finally that Geoffrey
himself was a youth and not of sufficient stature to be seen as King.

Matilda had been married off to Geoffrey by her father when she was 25, and Geoffrey was
just 13, in an attempt to secure Normandy’s southern border. It seems that Geoffrey’s youth
no more impressed Matilda than it did the Anglo-Norman barons. In addition, Geoffrey as a
mere Duke’s son was a far cry from being an Emperor, like her first husband, and to which
title she retained to herself.

Her first marriage as a child had been to Henry, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he died in
1125 when Matilda was aged about 23 after about 15 years of marriage. However, the
marriage was childless, and this left the Empress Matilda with no power base, and she
returned to her father, who subsequently used her for the Anjou alliance.

Her rival, Stephen of Blois, moved extremely swiftly upon the death of Henry I, and had
himself crowned in London. Matilda and Geoffrey apparently didn’t see the danger and may
have been distracted by solidifying their place in Normandy, and the Channel became the
permeable border between the two campaigns. Initially Stephen seemed to have gained the
advantage and the throne outright, but lacked political skill, which led to some barons
defecting back to Matilda, and he actually allowed Matilda to land unmolested in England
initially.

King Stephen was married to Matilda, Countess of Boulogne in her own right. In 1141, the
Empress captured Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln and moved to London to be crowned as
Queen. Countess Matilda meanwhile raised an army. The Empress was evicted from London
by its citizens, who were already a powerful burgh, probably as a mixture of political
machinations by Stephen’s allies and her oft reported high-handedness. It is a common
critique of powerful women at the time, but the reports for the Empress, as well as her
insistence on the title, are widespread enough, that it seems she genuinely would repeatedly
unnecessarily antagonise potential allies with her behaviour.

After this, the Empress went to besiege Winchester, where Stephen’s brother, Henry, was
bishop. Countess Matilda brought her army there and routed the siege, in the process
capturing Robert of Gloucester, the Empress’s half-brother and keystone supporter in
England. Robert was exchanged for Stephen and the status quo restored.

Empress Matilda had a son Henry who became involved in the war as he got older. Countess
Matilda has a son Eustace who also fought. However, Eustace died suddenly in 1153,
removing Stephen’s obvious heir, although there was a s younger son. Nevertheless, later
that year and into 1154, after 15 years of war, the Anarchy came to an end with the
agreement that Stephen would rule for his lifetime and then be succeeded by the Empress’s
son Henry. That happened sooner than anyone probably expected when Stephen died in
October 1154 and Henry became Henry II. And his reign is a whole other story...

24) The Heptarchy.

The tradition was that there had been seven Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: East Anglia, Essex, Kent,
Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex, and Wessex. There were many other original kingdoms, which
were gradually swallowed up by more powerful rivals. The last four standing were those
eventually brought under the rule of Æthelstan. A large number of these kingdoms leave
their mark in counties or regions.

25) Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid or Máel Sechnaill I

Viking Dublin was largely known as a slave-trading port, although that wasn’t the only trade.
Given that all the cultures of Britain and Ireland at the time were slave owning cultures,
Dublin was well located for selling people captured on raids as slaves. Slavery was an
institution set in law and not systematically opposed. It gradually died out and seems to
have largely disappeared by about 1200 within the British Isles.

26) King Offa of Mercia

[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gold-dinar-of-king-offa](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gold-dinar-of-king-offa)

The coin is copied from the contemporary Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. Errors in copying
indicate that the Arabic wasn’t understood, and possibly wasn’t even understood to be
writing. The fact that such a coin was copied though would seem to reflect that the original
gold coins were recognised as reliable currency, and that there was trade contact between
the Anglo-Saxons kingdoms and the Islamic world.

Offa reigned from 754-796, and was a contemporary of Charlemagne, who imposed a trade
embargo after Offa made what was interpreted as an insulting marriage offer. Charlemagne
was in contact with the northern border of Islamic Spain himself, and a trade embargo
against Offa may well have induced Mercian traders to push down the continental coast to
Spain.
