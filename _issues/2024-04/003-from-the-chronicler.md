Greetings friends,

Thank you for your patience with the publication of this issue of the Baelfyr, due to a combination of preparations for Spring Crown and modern life travel. I expect to delay the next couple of issues also, to space them out before returning to the first of the month for a future issue.

If you were a herald or contestant at Spring Crown, do please send your boast to [chronicler@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:chronicler@insulaedraconis.org) for publication in the May issue.

In service,
Chronicler.
