title: From the Chronicler
---

Greetings, friends!

Welcome to my first issue of the Baelfyr. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to it; I'm tremendously grateful.

With the support of our webminister, Marcella, and my predecessor as chronicler, Lucrezia, we've been working for the past few months to bring the Baelfyr to the web. This is something we've wanted to do for a long time, with a couple of attempts, and it's harder than it looks.

So I'm thrilled to announce that this edition of the Baelfyr has been simultaneously sent to your inbox, and published at [https://baelfyr.insulaedraconis.org](https://baelfyr.insulaedraconis.org).

I'll be really glad to hear what you think about this edition. Drop me a message at [chronicler@insualedraconis.org](mailto:chronicler@insulaedraconis.org).

In service,  
Sela (patent pending)
