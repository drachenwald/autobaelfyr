Unto the populace of Insulae Draconis do Ranulf &amp; Euphrosyne send peace and warm
greetings.

The pleasant chill of autumn is quickly settling upon these Our isles of Insulae Draconis. In
the weeks past, we have seen a potential new event and event site be tested in the Shire of
Harpelstane. Thank you to the event organisers who worked so hard to make Shieldbank
Skirmishes happen!

This month marks the opening of the lists for the Insulae Draconis Coronet Tournament.
Though with the aid of Our court alchemists, magicians, and astrologers, We are planning to
reign eternally, the Seneschal insists that it is best to have Heirs. Just in case.

Therefore, in accordance with ancient law and custom, We direct all nobles of good heart to
provide their Letters of Intent to the Seneschal no later than the first day of the new year. As
is Our right, We also command that each couple who would seek to rule these Isles must
submit a modest Arts &amp; Sciences project for display/performance at the Coronet
Tournament, completed by their own hands in the twelve months preceding said tournament.

All nobles intending to participate in the Coronet Tournament should remind themselves of
the additional entry requirements found on the Insulae Draconis website.

We are also looking far ahead to that time when Our heirs rule, and We see war in the
future. The great Kingdom of Drachenwald, of which this Principality is but a part, will be
taking the field at Pennsic War 50, and to mark this memorable occasion Drachenwald
seeks to bring a mighty army across the seas. We encourage all nobles of Insulae Draconis
to start making their plans to assist Drachenwald’s Sovereigns when the call to war is
sounded.

Pennsic War 50 will take place at Cooper’s Lake Campground, Pennsylvania, USA, from 28
July to 13 August 2023.

In faith and trust,  
Ranulf &amp; Euphrosyne  
Prince &amp; Princess of Insulae Draconis
