Greetings Insulae Draconis, 

The first thing I want to do in my premier letter to the Populace, is to thank His Lordship Guy de Dinan for his excellent work in the Office of Principality Seneschal. He has done a fabulous job, and I hope I can live up to the standard he set. He has put a huge amount of work into many policies important to the Principality, not the least of which is the Updated Safeguarding Policy that is nearly ready to make official. 

I would be remiss if I did not mention Their Highnesses, Prince Alexander of Derlington and Princess Agnes Boncuer, I look forward to working with them both moving forward. 

I am excited to work with all of the Principality Officers, and to support them in any way I can. Including the Accessibility, Diversity, and Inclusion Team. 

I will do my best to make sure our fair Principality prospers and that we grow in numbers and in Joy. 

Yours in Service,

Baron Meliton  
Seneschal, Insulae Draconis
