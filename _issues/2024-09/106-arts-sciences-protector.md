_The Arts & Sciences Protector display took place at the Ormthing in August. It was run by Viscountess Euphrosyne as the former A&S Protector._

There were 9 displays from very skilled A&S competitors.

- 3 pieces of hand woven cloth by Viscountess Eibhlin Ni Ghallchobair
- Handmade Coconut Cup and Coconut Sipping Cup by Viscount Duncan Forbes
- Hand Painted Pottery Collections by Lord Maredudd ap Gwylim
- Illustration for poem "A Winter's Tale" by Master Richard Of Salesberie
- Mid 15th century Burgundian Gown by Katherine Of Okynfirth 
- Salt cured and hot smoked leg of Lamb by Frú Aðísla Arnulfsdóttir
- Writ for Order of Chivalry on French Parchment by Mistress Arianhwy wen
- Two Styles of medieval Rosary by Mistress Catlin le Mareschale
- Two forms of decorative headband by Hannah Zamoyska of Lancaster 

All of the displays were breathtakingly beautiful and gathered so much attention from the populace.
I heard so many "Wow" and "Ahhhh So beautiful" from all over.

This display took the form of voting from populace and each person voted on only one display of their choice.
Result came in with much joy for the new A&S protector and bright future of Insulae Draconis.

Mater Richard of Salesberie took 1st place and became a new A&S protector to serve our mighty Highnesses.
His well known talent and skills will spread all over the isles and help and support all the amazing artisans to shine more than ever. And I will assure this will bring  their Highnesses more joy.

And Also wanted to mention, Fru Adisla and Hannah both came in Second place from only one point short from 1st place. 

I am truly grateful for all the populace's support and understanding during my time as A&S Protector.
