## Stuffed Eggs  
Marcella di Cavallino (Turi Henderson-Palmer)  
2003  

Serves 6

- 6 hard-boiled eggs
- ¼ C Ricotta Cheese
- 1 tsp Fine Spices*
- 1 ½ tsp each Fresh Basil, Rosemary, Oregano
- ¼ tsp Salt
- 2 tbsp White Wine Vinegar

Hard-boil eggs, cool, peel, slice in half lengthwise, and carefully remove the yolk. Combine egg
yolks with the remaining ingredients in a food processor, and blend until smooth. Spoon or
pipe mixture back into egg white halves. Dust with sugar or Fine Spices and serve.

*Fine Spices were a pre-made mixture based on Scappi’s recipe, and includes cinnamon, cloves,
ginger, nutmeg, grains of paradise, and brown sugar.

### Adaptations

There are about as many variants of this dish as there are cooks in history, so I used a recipe
from a 15 th c. cookbook, rather than a 16 th c. one, because I’d done it before and knew it would
be good. The deviations from the original recipe are that I used a pre-made dried Italian
seasoning mixture, included white wine vinegar to add some tartness and a bit of liquid to
replace the raw egg, and didn’t do the second round of frying after stuffing as it makes the eggs
weird and rubbery in ways that can be deeply unappetising.
