We recently held the 30 th anniversary event for the Kingdom of Drachenwald near Venlo in the
Netherlands. Shannon and myself drove there, others took the train or flew, used a ferry or various
combinations depending on where we started. From Insulae Draconis we had to cross water, if on
the European continent, then uninterrupted land travel was possible. Some even came from across
the Atlantic. For those of us travelling within the Kingdom, unless we made a deliberate stop
enroute, the journey could be accomplished in a day.

We think nothing of it. Further, safe arrival is almost guaranteed. Air crashes are extremely rare, as
are train crashes and ferry sinkings. Whilst relatively risky to those, car travel is still extremely safe
itself. I would not expect to fall ill en route, and if I did it would be extremely unlikely to be life-
threatening, and unless suddenly fatal. Modern medical assistance would be close at hand. I would
not expect to be waylaid or robbed. If I did stop, I can make sure that accommodation is available for
me well ahead of time which will guarantee a proper bed, a private room, bathroom facilities, most
likely ensuite, and ready access to sufficient food and drink.

In short, barring the inconvenience of a traffic jam or a delay on mass transit, I would expect to
arrive safely, quickly, in comfort, well fed and watered and little more than slightly tired at Venlo,
regardless of where in Europe I started from. Indeed, given the scope of the SCA, I would expect to
be able to manage that wherever I started within the Knowne World of the SCA’s kingdoms, with
perhaps Lochac or some of the East Asian territories being the only ones requiring more than 24
hours.

Easy, quick, comfortable, and safe. Now.

But what about my persona.? Or yours? And that is what I want to make you think about. I’m not
going to go into detail about what my persona would experience, but rather try and inspire
questions about what your persona would have had to go through. In fact, reading this article back
to myself, it is in many ways more a stream of thoughts and ‘whatabouts’, and that suits my purpose
quite well.

It wouldn’t have been easy. Or quick. Or comfortable. Or safe. The last would have varied
considerably depending on such factors as weather or politics.

To explore what we think about I’ll focus on my own journey with Shannon.

### My Modern Journey

I live a couple of villages north of Cambridge, now in England in the United Kingdom. Because we
were bringing a fair bit of kit, Shannon drove. We also decided on a deliberate stop of a few nights in
Brugge on the way. We chose to cross the water by going under the Channel using Le Shuttle, which
takes 35 minutes from Ashford to Calais. We left home about 14:00 BST and arrived in Brugge
around 21:00 BST. IT took about 3 hours to the remainder of the journey to Venlo via Antwerp a few
days later. We did the return journey in a single day (this time making sure to avoid Antwerp) in
about 11 hours. A rough approximation this is a distance of 600km or 375 miles.

Alternatively, we could have taken ferries from Dover to get to Calais. There are alternative ports,
such as Harwich, which could have got us directly to the Netherlands.

### The Basics

So switching to my persona journey, there are several factors that would be common, regardless of
when I was making this journey, with kit. The assumption of the SCA is that we are all nobles which
does at least give us some advantages in terms of access to resources such as horses, servants and
money, assuming of course that your persona originates in a monied economy. If I was travelling
from early Anglo-Saxon Waterbeach, from the kingdom of East Anglia, I would need to figure out
how to convert my land and food based worth into something transportable.

### The Sea

The only option for crossing to the Continent would be boat, of varying quality depending on the
era. Today’s train or ferry travel, where you can cross at will, regardless of season or weather, is far
different from what our personas would experience. The prevailing wind would shift depending
upon the time of year, the weather be pretty much unpredictable and the quality of the ships and
their crews uncertain. There were no dedicated ferries. As William, Duke of Normandy, found out in
1066 the wind could confound travel for an entire season. In 1120 the sinking of the White Ship
killed the heir to the Kingdom of England and led eventually to the civil war that was the Anarchy
when King Henry died.

Once you did find a ship and suitable weather, the crossing itself would only take a few hours from
Dover to Calais, and given prevailing winds, usually a little longer to return.

### Why Dover to Calais?

There were routes to cross the sea, probably many more ad hoc than the very regular ferry routes of
today. So why might a persona choose a particular route. For myself, then why Dover to Calais?

As the shortest crossing, it would be the least vulnerable to turns in the weather whilst on board,
and similarly the most reliable in terms of managing a crossing at any given time. It was also a major
trade route and so would have a more ships likely to be making a crossing at any given time.

As a trade route, it would make a good crossing possible for any of us engaged in trade, whether as a
wealthy merchant or a noble. For example, the Staple of Calais would have a large number of ships
sailing from London and Dover when the wool had been collected and packed. For trade travel in the
latter part of our period, a land trip via London would be useful as it would allow preparations to be
made such as exchange letters. These were effectively two way agreements to deliver an amount of
local currency to the bearer of a letter, instead of having to carry around large amounts of cash,
which would be vulnerable to potential pirates and/pr privateers in the Channel, depending on
whom was currently at war. These agreements were also a way of profiting from loans without
engaging in usury.

Additionally, for most of the medieval period Canterbury was the major religious establishment in
what would become England, even as far back as the Heptarchy of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It
would never hurt to have God on your side when crossing the sea and taking long journeys.

### Trade

For those familiar with the Cely Letters and the wool trade generally, these cities will be familiar.
Whilst the wool itself would be traded at Calais, the first Continental stop, most of the payments
would be made later in the year at markets at Brugge and Antwerp.

Venlo itself is on the River Meuse, was a trading port on the river, and was a member of the
Hanseatic League from 1375. The Meuse thus also provides another route to reach Venlo instead of
over land. This could be a double-edged sword, as it allowed easy access for Viking raids, for those
with an appropriate persona.

### Land Travel

Unlike today, it’s impossible to give an average speed of travel. The time of year and the weather
conditions would make a huge difference. Mid-winter snows could make travel impossible; dry
summer days would be fastest, but get too hot and your horses are going to need more frequent
breaks and more water, as are you. At least for this journey, the route is fairly flat for the most part.
Given our trip was mid-June, and the weather has been good for a prolonged spell, let’s look at the
upper end. If our party was entirely on horseback, we might achieve about 40 miles (~60km) per day
under ideal conditions. That equates to about 10 days (plus time to get across the Channel) for the
trip, about a day per modern hour.

But, are your party and horses regular long distance travellers, accustomed to being in the saddle all
day for well over a week? If not, it seems likely that the pace would be slower and punctuated with
more breaks, and possibly entire days of rest, especially on Sundays.

If you are travelling with significant luggage or goods requiring a cart your pace would likely be half
that at best, and would most likely be getting on for a month.

And what if the purpose isn’t a direct trip to Venlo, but more focused on conducting trade. That
would lead to lengthy stops at major cities and their markets.

I’ve focused on the land times in this section, because modernly that is how we generally travel. It is
quickest and simplest, not relying on schedules made by others. However, the medieval reality is
that, if we were dedicated to fast, direct travel to Venlo, we probably wouldn’t travel by land much
at all. It would be far quicker and safer to travel by the waterways, such as the Meuse, even if it
meant a longer sea journey to reach the mouth of the river.

### War

Not all hazards are natural or simple brigandage. Since the end of WW2, war has been a distant
concept for us, and has rarely bothered England at home for several centuries, most of our wars
being fought elsewhere. This was not true for our period.

The English, section would have been the safest from this point of view over time, as even in Anglo-
Saxon times with various warring kingdoms, within and without their own borders (in this case East
Anglia, Mercia, Kent later subsumed by Wessex), much of the conflict would have been between
small warbands, rather than large armies. There were other dangerous times, such as in the years
following the Conquest, the Anarchy, Louis’s invasion against King John, various revolts, and the flare
ups during the Wars of the Roses, but still relatively quite compared to the Continental side.

The Low Countries were racked with conflict much of the time. Looking for a quick list I came across
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_in_the_Low_Countries_until_1560](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_in_the_Low_Countries_until_1560).
It seems that only
relatively peaceful era when you wouldn’t have to think about who was, or might be about to, start
fighting was during the 10 th century. These wars weren’t just isolated to the area, and would often
involve England or France in some capacity, and that could often make the Channel treacherous as
privateers would be out in force for one side or the other.

Calais was a prominent part of English territory for 200 years, from 1347 until 1558, along with
varying amounts of country around it. During this period that leg would have been a common
cultural and currency zone, of not always peaceful.

### Disease and Injury

Today, you expect to return from your journey in the same state as you left, when you planned.
Recent years put a slight dent in that with Covid, and even as late as last year I would up stuck in
Berlin as a consequence. But the German health system is modern, and I was vaccinated, so the
issue was more bureaucratic than one of serious illness.

Your persona, however, would not have this expectation. Indeed, illness and death were a very real
potential outcomes, and certainly a reason for the preventative visit in Canterbury. Much of the time
the risk would have been a constant background of disease variants that you hadn’t been exposed to
before. Occasionally though, there were flare up of plagues which would have made you wary to
travel and the locals not particularly welcoming of strangers. The most famous example would be
that of the Black Death which swept across Europe and into England in the late 1340s.
We would generally expect to be competent riders as nobles, but riding accidents could give you
anything from a scratch to get infected to broken bones. The quality and quantity of food and drink
would be variable depending on the season and that year’s climate, exposing you to all kinds of
parasitic and other gut problems, as well as just simple hunger and thirst if the conditions or politics
were wrong.

### Maybe we should just stay home?

Even at its best, this journey to Venlo is going to be long and tiring. It’s not unlikely that they’ll be
some trial or other, delays and waiting that would make a ferry strike pale into insignificance, and
we might not return at all. So why on earth would we actually contemplate it? Well for a long
weekend away, we wouldn’t.

However, dangerous as the trip is, it is still most likely that we’ll return safe and healthy. More risk
does not mean overwhelming risk, most of the time. And where there are hardships, there are
generally also profits if you have the mindset and capital. Someone will generally pay for transported
goods, if you pick the right ones.

Or there is diplomacy to conduct, perhaps at the Carolingian court, perhaps through back channels
between Elizabethan England and Spain. Diplomacy can make reputations, which could also mean
wealth, whether through promotions or gifts.

Maybe you see profit, but not by trade or reputation, but simple taking it. You may be raiding as a
Viking, or travelling as a mercenary to sell your services to ones side of a war or another. The
potential gains are high, as are the risks, but there will also be adventure and a chance to see the
world, even if the world won’t be that keen to see you.

There’s also a chance to see to your spiritual well-being by visiting various shrines and religious
centres. This will be especially the case if you’re a Christian where pilgrimage is virtue. Or maybe
your persona is in religious orders, a common destination for younger born nobles, and travelling on
church business.

So despite all the hardships and all the risks, there is profit to made from travelling, whether
material, reputational or spiritual. If your persona has ambitions, and the weather has been
reasonable, and your sovereign isn’t currently at war, and you have the wealth to afford horses and
other supplies, then maybe now is a good time to travel to Venlo. Make sure to have someone look
after the house though, you won’t be home for many weeks at best.
