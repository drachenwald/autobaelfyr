Greetings, friends!

First, an erratum from last month: I'm still tweaking my Automatic Baelfyr machine, and ommitted
the Insulae Draconis Captain of Archers from the list of officers last month. My apologies to
Kier of Eplaheimr.

We've had an extraordinarily active month with five different in-person events across the
Principality, and an online Learned Discourse. From the joyful occasion of Crown Tourney in Depedene,
we bring a selection of the boasts; and from Dun in Mara's revel we have the memories
of some of our members attending their first event.

In the past, people have cemented their own memories by writing post-event reports; I would
love to publish some of these in future. Send them to
[chronicler@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:chronicler@insulaedraconis.org).

In service,  
Sela (Drachenwald patent #363)
