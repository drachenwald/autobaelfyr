Greetings, friends!

An erratum: I'm still tweaking my Baelfyr machine, and omitted
the Captain of Archers from the list of principality officers last month.
My apologies to Kier of Eplaheimr.

We've had an extraordinarily active month: five in-person events and an
online Learned Discourse. In the past, people have cemented their own
memories by writing post-event reports; I would love to publish some of these in future.
Send them to [chronicler@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:chronicler@insulaedraconis.org).

In service,  
Sela (Drachenwald patent #363)
