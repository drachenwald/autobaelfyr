Autumn Crown took place in Depedene this past month and, as is tradition, the noble competitors were
heralded into the tourney with creativity, skill and panache. Here are some of the boasts.

<br />

### Alexandre & Agnes
*by Aodhan Dha Cheist*

Your Majesties, Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Your Graces, assorted Rabble,

I bring before you Master Alexadre D'Avignon and Lady Agnes Boncuer, these worthy Nobles wish to fight today in your tourney.

Master Alexandre, you know well. When I think of Master Alexandre I think of 4 numbers, 4.

One. First, his voice is the first voice many people will hear at any given court. It is Distinctive!  
Two. Seconds, as anyone who has eaten one of Master Alexandres feasts will say, Yes please!  
Three. Orders, have asked this man to be one of their members, the Laurels, the Pelicans and the order of Defence. 
And 4. Quarter, is what he will give to his opponents on this field today when they fall before him.

Additionally, have you seen him? Look, look at that hair, LOOK at that hair! I mean, I was looking at it this
morning and I was thinking, Maybe he's born with it, maybe it's Majesty!  

With regards to Lady Agnes, I genuinely, genuinely struggled to properly come up with a boast for Lady Agnes.  
Not because she is not worthy of this, she is manifestly worthy.  
Eventually yesterday, on my travels here I realised,  the word for Lady Agnes is Solid.  
Lady Agnes is the Bedrock of fighting in this kingdom, she is the Oak Beam that holds the walls up.  
She has taken so many fighters under her wing, several of which are actually fighting before you today.  
She is worthy of this Honour.

### Yda & Sela

*Composed by Alexandre d'Avignon, heralded by Genevieve la flechiere*

Comes now Yda with purpose true  
With sword and wisdom shining bright  
To test her skill and show her might  
As Drachenwaldi warriors do.

Sela, dame of great insight,  
Inspires Yda with courage new  
So that her foes this day will rue  
That Yda they must face in fight.

For Yda, swift like striking kite,  
Will swing her blade, her foes to hew,  
While Sela urges her anew,  
With visage full of lambent light.

Fair Sela, web-scop, wise and true,  
Whose worth is more than silver bright  
Gives counsel, so her champion might  
Great deeds of valour this day do.

Yda et Sela, feminae fortae  
Hodie pugnant ad coronae

### Joel and Valda
*By Joel ben Stuart (some assistance from Lin Manual Miranda)*

Your Majesties, your Highnesses, your excellencies and everyone else!  
I am Joel ben Stuart, you know who I am!  
When I win this this tournament I will be but one of a line of men who have won this great honour.

BUT this is Valda ingen Caom… you also know who she is!  
When she wins this tournament every one will wish that they were at the event where it happened!  
The Event where it happened!  
The Event where it happened!  
No one knows how the bills are paid,  
The art of the trade,  
How the sausage gets made  
We just assume events happen,  
And wish that we where at the event where it happened!  
On day Dame Lyonet was on our doorstep in distress and disarray,  
Lyonet said “I’ve nowhere else to turn.” And basically begged her to join the fray.  
She approached Brighthelm and said, “I know you’re villains but lets hear what she’s going to pay!”  
Well she arranged this beating! She arranged the menu, the venue and the seating!  
And we wish to be at the event where it happens!

### Valdemare and Anna
*By Genevieve Rouge Maunche*

Make way, make way for Countess Anna von Urwald, founding baroness of Aarnimetsa,
who inspired Marcus Eisenwald to victory in Insulae Draconis!

Deadly with a sword - dragon's steel and defender both - more devastating still in her
magnificent attire, her snow white defender's collar blinds her opponents! Her deep, dark,
beautiful and costly black gown strikes terror in their hearts...
...but fear not for your safety today!

Today she lends her inspiration to Lord Valdemar Rodvilde, squire of her household,
guardian of the Vita Porten, to mighty deeds in her name, to advance her renown,
and ensure the line of Drachenwald.

### Orianna and Alex of Longriston
*By Joel ben Stuart*

Your Majesties, your Highnesses, your excellencies and everyone else!  
My last boast was a bit on the long side so this one is snappier! Let me introduce these two!  
Lord Alexander of Longriston.  
Lady Oriana Nic Kendrick.  
He is a badger loving piper, a fox, a doughty warrior a drummer and an all round great guy.  
She is a glamorous seamstress with a client list that includes mercenaries, princes and queens!  
Together they fight crime!

Wait a mo…  
Together they fight in CROWN!

### Ellisif and Jon
*By Duncan Kerr*

Yours Majesties, honoured princes good gentles all

I would speak of **virtue** of **skill** and of **service** for it is of these things are
Kings and Queens made.

Any who have meet Lord Jon upon the field know of his Chivalry on field.
Word of his noble deeds has spread across the kingdom and beyond.
His generosity and nobility shine for all to see. Maestra Ellisif’s courage to do the
difficult, tedious or unglamorous is a sign of her nobility. Her Generosity both in time
and energy helps create a strong, rich kingdom.

Ellisif’s skill with the loam and the brush is well known. As is the joy which she teaches
those skills. Jon’s is not without skill most recent he has been casting pewter.

Although they have relatively recent moved to Drachenwald there service is well known.
If John had a pound for every tent peg he pounded in at Double Wars he would be a very
wealthy man. Ellisif gives of her time to create works of art that decorate many home
and also rans and helps to run events. Together they are strong pillars that
support our kingdom.

For all these reasons I say to you Drachenwald rejoice, rejoice, rejoice for Ellisif
and Jon will your King and Queen.

### Krake and Beatrix

**Krake**  
Famous far farer  
First to the field

Sure and swift  
Shrewd with sage council

Fell to foes  
Firm in Friendship

**Beatrix**

Wide doors welcome  
Weary wonderers find rest

Bringers of the spear storms

Each inspiration and inspired  
United and unbending

Throned treasure-chieftains  
Triumphant together
