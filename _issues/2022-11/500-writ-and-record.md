## Marriage Settlement of William Huckvale and Mary Rawbone

My recent enforced stay in Berlin, unfortunately causing me to miss the last Crown
Tournament, did allow me to get some transcriptions of the Huckvale Papers done, for
which I had been struggling to find the time. As a precursor to these, however, this
month’s document is a marriage settlement for the marriage of William Huckvale the
younger and Mary Rawbone (or Rabon) dated to the 1 st October 1668.

So why a document dating from the reign of Charles II, and past even the grey period
for the SCA? The reasons are several. The marriage settlement as a general procedure
is indicative of period, and is interesting of itself. However, this particular document,
between the fathers of the bride and groom, Major Rawbone (1606-1694) and William
Huckvale the elder (1594-aft. 1668), men who were born each side of 1600 (and
consequently lived through the Civil War and Interregnum), mentions details about
some of the land which involve two earlier generations of Huckvales, taking us well back
into the 16 th century.

So we have later evidence of names from period. Most are unremarkable, but Major
Rawbone’s is notable. Major (also written as Maior) is not a title, but a given name, as
evidenced by his baptism in Haseley, Warwickshire at the tail end of 1606. He is not
alone in having this name in the area at that time. This caught me out a few years back
when I first came across the name, which was later in his life, and hence not obviously
actually a name.

From a genealogical point of view (which is my driver for which documents I end up
examining), the document confirms four generations of father/son relationships, which is
quite unusual. As a result we know that from the groom back in time, we have William,
William, Cuthbert and John. John takes us from the early decades of the 16 th century
(his exact birth date is currently unclear) until his death just a month before Major’s
baptism. It is the documents concerning the transactions of Cuthbert and John that are
in the Huckvale Papers and I’ll cover in future articles.

The schedule gives an interesting list of land and field names, which in general don’t
change much over time, along with their occupiers, which is typical before and
afterwards, to describe where the ;and dealt with by the settlement is located. The
difference to today’s deeds is that the lands is largely located relative to other land
and/or the occupiers. At the time of writing that probably would have been clear enough,
but as time goes on it becomes almost impossible to determine exactly where the plots
are located, and would require a database of who owned, or occupied, what land when.
The Huckvales were big fish in the little pond of Over Norton and its parish of Chipping

Norton, Oxfordshire for nearly 400 years, from the early 16 th century until the end of 19 th
century. Yet by the start of the 20 th the name had completely vanished from the county
with those born there moved to London. They do however provide me a personal
gateway back into period and the late 15 th century, with a probable, but unproven
ancestry into the late 14th.

My work on the Huckvale family is recorded in WikiTree (wikitree.com), with their own
project page at [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Huckvale_Name_Study](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Huckvale_Name_Study). I used to
record most of the transcriptions and translation I did on my own blog, but it makes
more sense to integrate them into the collaborative genealogical project. This particular
document is at <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Marriage_Settlement_-_William_Huckvale_-_Mary_Rabon_-_1668_-_Oxfordshire_O12/69D/2">this location</a>.


The transcription follows the layout of the original, wide landscape document, which
makes referring back to the original much easier, so the layout in our modern portrait
scheme will look a little odd as each original line takes up about a line and a half in the
layout I’m writing this article (and may change again for publication). Unlike the Cely
Papers, I haven’t provided a modernized version of the text, but I think it is pretty
understandable as is. If in doubt read a section aloud, which is a useful trick for any old
English texts. Even if it looks incomprehensible, it will often be understandable when
read aloud phonetically.
