Unto the populace of Insulae Draconis do Ranulf & Euphrosyne send peace and warm
greetings.

We rejoice, for the Kingdom of Drachenwald has heirs! Crown Prince Krake and Crown
Princess Beatrix have, through wisdom and valour, stood forth to ensure an unbroken
line of succession. We honour them and look forward to their reign!

As We look forward to the impending winter months, We encourage all nobles of the
Principality to consider scheduling events, either in person or online. It is not an SCA
requirement that events be large and complex, and often a simple Baronial or Shire
gathering day goes a long way towards building group spirit and developing new interests.
We would very much like to support you in your efforts, so please reach out to Us with your
event ideas.

And, of course, We remind all of the Principality’s nobles that Our reign will not last forever,
because at a certain point We plan to retire to the balmier climate of Antioch and live off the
royal pension fund. As such, if you wish to be the successors to Our reign of tyranny, We
remind you that now is the time to send in your Letters of Intent, as the cut-off date for
submissions is January 1, 2023.

In faith and trust,  
Ranulf & Euphrosyne  
Prince & Princess of Insulae Draconis
