Greetings, friends!

I am delighted to announce that Lord Meldun (previously of Adamastor, lately of Harpelstane) has joined as deputy chronicler, and we are looking forward to working as a team to produce the Baelfyr. Both Meldun and I can be reached at **chronicler@insulaedraconis.org** as usual.

In service,  
Sela
