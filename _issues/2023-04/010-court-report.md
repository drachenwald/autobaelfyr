This is a court report for Coronet Tournament. Coronet Tournament was
organised by Thamesreach.

This was a Nordmark court at ID's principality coronet.

This court report is for court on 11 Feb 2023, it's identified as
Saturday Evening Court.

Court report filed by: Presiding Royalty, Prince Stigot

The laughing court! I had the great honour of sitting next to Prince
Alexandre d'Avignon during the banquet. We talked different designs on
coronettes. Normarks is made in sections, which makes it easy to
change in size. Prince Alexandre d'Avignon showed that the ID's
coronet is one size and very large by happily pulling it over his head
down to his shoulders. When he was about to take off the coronet, he
got stuck in his hair so me and Princess Eularia had to help him
loose. We smiled a little but made no big deal out of Prince
Alexandre's bad luck. When Prince Alexandre then during court, again,
got stuck with the coronet in his hair, I couldn't contain myself
for laughter. The whole court had fun, including Prince Alexandre.
It's been a long time since I've laughed so much! Yes and under the
court of ID we had a Nordmark court, then Lord Ranulf Li Norreis got
Nordmark's sparre.

Ranulf Li Norreis: Nordmarks sparre, Scroll given (Stigot Lo Molly), no token

This is a court report for Mynydd Gwyn Eisteddfod 2023. Mynydd Gwyn
Eisteddfod 2023 was organised by Mynydd Gwyn.

Insulae Draconis court was held by Alexandre and Eularia

This court report is for court on 11 Mar 2023, it's identified as
Saturday Afternoon Court.

Court report filed by: Court Herald, Maredudd ap Gwylim,

The Eisteddfod having been held to determine (by choice of Their
Highnesses) the second Bard of Mynydd Gwyn, the Chairing of the Bard
ceremony may only occur when there is peace in the land. The herald
asked three times “A oes Heddwch?” (Is there peace?) and each time the
sword carrier partially unsheathed the ceremonial sword (in case the
answer should be negative). Each time the populace replied “Heddwch!”
(Peace!) and the sword was firmly slid back into its scabbard. Peace
being confirmed, Their Highnesses announced Their Will that Lady
Cecily of Okynfirth should be seated beside them in the silver Bardic
Chair as the new Bard of Mynydd Gwyn. A scroll to commemorate her
winning (by Maredudd ap Gwylim) was presented.

Their Highnesses welcomed those for whom
this was their first Insulae Draconis Court (one completely new to the
Known World), and then also those children present.

Ysabella-Maria the Lazarene was commanded to appear where, Their
Highnesses being much pleased with the horoscope presented at Their
ascending to the Coronet, They were pleased to confirm the said Y-M as
Their Court Astrologer, for the duration or Their Reign (or until some
prediction should prove either false, or in some way displeasing to
Their Highnesses).

The Event team was thanked for their work.

The Members present of the Order of Ffraid were asked to stand, or
otherwise indicate their presence, and Lady Eleanor of Alvechurch was
called forward to join the Order (as is often the case, she seemed
confused as to why this might be so!) The scroll was by Lord Maredudd
ap Gwylim.

This is a court report for March Lune-acy. March Lune-acy was
organised by Depedene under Wychwood.

Insulae Draconis court was held by Alexandre & Eularia

This court report is for court on 25 Mar 2023, it's identified as
Saturday Evening Court.

Court report filed by: Court Herald, Ari Mala, daylightjam@gmail.com

There was no ID court on the Friday night; Their Highnesses sat in
Their Majesties’ court and were decorative.

Their Highnesses
created Lady Elen Benet their champion of arts and sciences. Not the
champion of the competitions that were run, but champion in the sense
that they have armoured, rapier, and archery champions. 

Children and newcomers were welcomed.

Yannick of Normandy was named Royal Cartographer.

The A and S competition winners were announced: Lady Afriðr won with
a lovely blue fur-lined hat. Mistress Maria Harsick won the people’
choice with her basket of “beginners’ braids”.

Lady Amphelise and Master Yannick announced that the long summer event
henceforward shall be known as Ormþing. They unveiled a banner for the
event that the good lady had
made. At this point there was speculation that perhaps Master Yannick
should just be called up for every item, as this was the fourth or
fifth time he was called into court—and he was already being a
pelican-in-waiting to Their Majesties! He wrote the story, read
eloquently by His Highness.

Lastly, Viscountess Lena was made a member of the Order of the Fox,
and Lady Leofrun had done a stunning scroll.

There being no further business, ID court was closed.
