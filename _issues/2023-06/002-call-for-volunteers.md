There's no seneschal letter this month, as the seneschal is busy supporting the Orm√æing event team.

Speaking of teams: we want to make sure the principality itself is supported by a strong
team of officers. Deputy seneschals are excellent positions from which to do that.
If you would be interested in volunteering as a deputy principality seneschal,
or you're not sure but are curious about what's involved,
please drop an email to [seneschal@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:seneschal@insulaedraconis.org).
