There's no seneschal letter this month, as the seneschal is busy supporting the Orm√æing event team.
We want to make sure there's a robust team in place to support the Principality,
and deputy seneschals are exellent positions from which to do that.
If you would be interested in volunteering as a deputy principality seneschal,
please drop an email to [seneschal@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:seneschal@insulaedraconis.org).
