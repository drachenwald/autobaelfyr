_Last month, your chronicler visited Fruits Of Our Labours in Ealdormere, and was appointed ambassador to bring the greetings of the King and Queen of Drachenwald to the Ealdormere Court._

_On discovering that the Queen of Ealdormere had an Irish name, I asked Aodh Ó Siadhail to write a poem to be read into court. Aodh delivered. I read the Irish, and Genevieve la flechiere read the translation. The Queen said that it made her ears happy._

#### A Trio of Triads for Her Majesty of Ealdormere

Trí rud a bhfuiltear ag tnúth leo:  
Cocaire, consort, is banríon.

_Three things that are delightful:_  
_A cook, a consort, a queen._

Trí rud is pléisiúr:  
Cuairt ó na Gaeil,  
Cuairt ar na Gaeil,  
Focail idir na Gaeil.

_Three things that are a pleasure:_  
_A visit from the Irish,_  
_A visit to the Irish,_  
_Words between the Irish._

Trí rud tuartha:  
Focail na banríona,  
An ghlóir maidir léi,  
Agus a cuairt ar a tír dhúcais

_Three things anticipated:_  
_The words of the queen,_  
_The glory of her regard,_  
_Her visit to her homeland._
