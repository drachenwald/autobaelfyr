May all who read these Presents know that on the second Friday afternoon of Ormþing to be
held during August next at Bourn in the county of Flintheath, the **Oxford Roll** will be held once
again. This tournament between the shires and baronies of Insulae Draconis will again pit their
armoured wærods against each other, vying to win the field. There will be many warriors who
have never witnessed or fought this tournament before. A brief outline of the rules follow. There
is precedent for the participation of royalty according to where they maintain their primary
residence within their domains.

### Rules of Entry

Residents of Insulae Draconis may only fight for the shire or barony in which they reside. They
may not sell their services.

Non-residents of Insulae Draconis may be hired as mercenaries by such who can afford their
price.

Wærods may ally upon the field, but a shire or barony may not cede, claim or share points to,
from or with another as part of the said alliance.

### The Rounds

There shall, as always, be three rounds.

The **first** shall be for control of a shield placed upon the ground for 20 minutes. The shield may
not be moved as part of combat. There shall be three holds, two at predetermined times known
only to the time-keeper and the last at 20 minutes. The shire whose member or mercenary is
closest shall win a point. If more than one shall have a foot upon the shield, or shall be judged to
be equidistant, then those individuals shall fight for the point. If there is a tie at the end of the
round, the final point shall have precedence, and the wærod with the most, or the precedent,
point shall carry one point forward.

The **second** shall be the last Monarch standing. Each shire or barony shall appoint one member
as Monarch. A mercenary may not be Monarch. Each wærod will identify, for all to know, their
monarch prior to start of combat. All wærods will take the field until but one monarch remains
alive. If a monarch is killed, the entire wærod must retire from the field. The last monarch wins a
point. If the last standing monarchs are killed simultaneously so that none remain, the round
shall be fought again with all wærods participating.

The **third** is last shire or barony standing. The round shall be fought until members and
mercenaries of but one wærod remain alive on the field. Mercenaries may remain on the field
for their wærod, even if all native members have been killed. The last wærod remaining, even if
but one warrior, wins the point. If the final combat leaves no wærod with a living member, then
the round shall be fought again with all wærods participating.

The wærod with the most points shall win the Oxford Roll. If there is a tie, the last point shall
have precedence, and the winners of the final round shall win the tournament.

### Useful Information

The last winner of this tournament was West Dragonshire.

The largest wærod upon the field has never yet won (at least in those I have witnessed), if we
forget that last year every wærod numbered but one warrior.

Brute force alone has been poor strategy in the past.
