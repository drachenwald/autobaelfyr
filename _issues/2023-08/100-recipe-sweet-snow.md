_Those who attended 30 Year or Cudgel may remember some remarkably tasty snow being served. Yda van Boulogne provides the recipe for this dessert._

Ingredients:

- shaved ice 
- sekanjabin syrup of your choice

Put shaved ice in bowl. Top with syrup. Enjoy!

Mint Sekanjabin:

Ingredients (by volume):

- 1.5 cup sugar (or honey if you want to be more accurate)
- 1 cup water
- 0.5 cup apple cider vinegar (~ to taste)
- a good helping of mint

Bring water to boil, add sugar and stir till dissolved. Keep at rolling boil point for 10 minutes and then take it of the fire.

Add cider vinegar (technically to taste, IIRC 1/2 cup was a good amount). Add mint & let steep for a few hours, ideally 1-2 days in the fridge.

Serve over shaved ice, or mixed with water, or dip some lettuce in it.

Pomegranate Sekanjabin:

Ingredients:  
(you're on your own for quantities, I kinda invented this one on site)

- sugar (less sugar than in above recipe as the molasses are sweet by themselves)
- water
- pomegranate molasses (check your local turkish shop)
- cider vinegar

Bring water to boil, add sugar & molasses. Keep at boiling point for about10 minutes and add the molasses.
Add cider vinegar to taste.

Serve like above, but maybe not try the lettuce.
