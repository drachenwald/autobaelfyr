Despite negotiations with our insurers and an exhaustive search for an alternative option, we have been unable to secure insurance that covers Equestrian Activities in Insulae Draconis beyond the 31st of July 2023. As a result, from that date and until we are able to get suitable public liability insurance for these activities **all SCA Equestrian Activity in Insulae Draconis is suspended.**

This is a regrettable situation but as many will know the cost of insurance has been sky-rocketing in recent times and to make matters worse an insurer recently left the market. The only option that would have covered equestrian had a few problems. As well as being extremely expensive it also did not adequately meet our other insurance needs and so we were not able to pursue that particular route.

Know that your equestrians will continue to practise in their own time such that if the situation changes we will be able to restart our activities again.

Many thanks for those who helped in the research to try to find new insurance and apologies for those who may be disappointed that we will not grace events for the foreseeable future.

As ever in service to the SCA,   
Thomas Flamanc of Kelsale.
