Hear ye, hear ye,

Their Royal Highnesses Insulae Draconis summon forth the populace to attend an online Parliament on
Thursday 21st September, 7pm to 9pm at the latest. Details at the end of this missive.

The Parliament is a formal gathering to discuss and pass changes to the laws of the Principality. These
are the in-game rules by which we govern our activities and are at all times subordinate to the laws of
real life jurisdictions within which we reside.

The working document version of the ID laws, with current proposals from the Coronet and the
Seneschallate is [found here, changes in red](

ring).

Please submit comments and suggested changes by 25th August (to allow for compiling and submission
to Baelfyr) to – seneschal@insulaedraconis.org

Changes will not be accepted on the night due to time.

Please prefix your edit suggestions with the numbering system in the document.

We are aware of the odd formatting issues within the document, they’ll be ironed out in the final
published version after the Parliament, so don’t need formatting edit proposals.

Voting on changes will be tabled as follows:

- Any motion that edits the laws and is amenable to the Coronet and Seneschallate will be
  incorporated into the main proposal for a vote.
- Any motion to take a separate vote on a new edit requiring discussion will be voted separately.*
- The Principality edits will be tabled as a whole.

*subject to acceptance by the Chair depending on time
