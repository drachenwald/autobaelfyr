Unto the populace of Insulae Draconis do Euphrosyne &amp; Ranulf send peace and warm
greetings.

We had a fantastic time at Yule Ball in the Shire of Flintheath, where we both had the
chance to learn new skills in the arts and sciences. Her Highness especially enjoyed the
opportunity to use a miniature flamethrower in the process of learning to make glass beads!

January, usually a month with few events here in the Isles, is a great time to think about the
care and maintenance of your medieval clothing, armour and ongoing projects. Therefore,
we celebrate the Barony of Eplaheimr and the Shire of Depedene under Wychwood and
their shared Collegium Armourum, where metal and leather workers gather to share the art
of armouring. For those of us who canâ€™t attend, we can still at least replace the old duct tape
patches with new ones.

In accordance with Principality law, the final date to submit a letter of intent for Coronet
Tournament is January 11th. This is a short extension from the previous cutoff, which was
set before We knew the dates of Coronet, with the intent of ensuring that no one submitted
their letter too late. Thank you to Our Webminister, Lady Marcella di Cavallino, for
developing the very convenient Google form for submissions, to which a link is found below!

In faith and trust,  
Ranulf &amp; Euphrosyne  
Prince &amp; Princess of Insulae Draconis
