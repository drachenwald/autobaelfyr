_* For everyone, not just apprentices_

A few years ago, at an event in An Tir, I picked up a little pamphlet produced by an apprentice (Portzia di Corbino Rosso from the Principality of Tir Righ) of things one could do to challenge themselves in the Arts and Sciences arena—not just to get and keep momentum going, but to push their own boundaries and support the creative arts in their area. It’s a good list and, if you’re like me, checking things off lists is very satisfying.
 
So, after making some adjustments to add a section on research (because it’s my jam), and to make it less Kingdom-specific, I offer it up to all of you as a potential framework off which you can hang your 2023 craft goals. Do as many or as few as you like!
 
(Note: This challenge may come with side effects, up to and including an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Always check with your Peer before embarking on any new regimen.)
