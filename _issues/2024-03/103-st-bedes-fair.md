St Bede’s Fair is named after the Venerable Bede, whose feast day is 25 May. St Bede is most famous for his work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in the early Eighth Century, and because of it he is often referred to as ‘The Father of English History.’
