Noble cousins,

Following the workshop in July, the Insulae Draconis Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) team will run another short "Bystander Intervention" workshop on Zoom to help empower our populace will the tools they need to intervene in harassment and other uncomfortable public interactions, 5-6pm on Saturday 9th November.

Bystander intervention provides different options for defusing and disrupting harmful behaviours, keeping everyone safe without escalating the situation. It is a useful skill to have in all areas of life, and we hope that those not already attending Kingdom University in Gotvik will be able to attend.

Yours in service,

Henric van den Casteele (they/them), on behalf of the Insulae Draconis DEIB team.

The DEIB team works with the Seneschal to increase awareness of relevant issues, promote relevant initiatives, and act as a point of contact for information and advice for relevant matters.
