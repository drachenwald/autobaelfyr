From the desk of the (Outgoing) MOAS Insulae Draconis:

**PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING YOUR NEW MOAS ID!**

As I look back over the past two years in my term as MOAS of Insulae Draconis I can honestly say that that it has been the most rewarding time that I have I spent in SCA so far.

Each month, I have been amazed, thrilled and on several occasions even startled by your collective creative and inspirational genius. I have constantly been touched by, and have often been privileged to bear witness to your overwhelming kindness and willingness to help one another; to be so welcoming and to accept each other - 'just as you are' - which I think in the times that we live in today is so very, very important.

I feel confident that my successor will carry high the burning brightly Candle of this office - and am positive that this office will move from strength to strength under her gentle guidance.

I would like you all then to join with me in giving a very warm and special Insulae Draconis welcome to your new Minister of Arts and Science Officer for Insulae Draconis - The Honorable Lady **Órlaith Caomhánach**.

And of course I cant resist one final plea – does your Shire have a vacant A&S officer? If not could you spare a couple of hours each quarter to? If so please contact your MOAS ID officer at [moas@insulaedraconis.org](moas@insulaedraconis.org) for more information.
