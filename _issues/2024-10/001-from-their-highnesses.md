Unto the populace of Insulae Draconis greetings.

The season of war draws to a close, the wheat is harvested and the fruits and nuts hang ripe from the trees. As we all gaze upon our beloved land and marvel at its riches, we consider our strengths and weaknesses and how we may position ourselves so that future generations may continue to enjoy the fruits of our principality and the glorious spectacle that is our society.

We consider that the fullest harvests are reaped in those shires, cantons and hamlets where collective action and spirit are strong. Where wise seneschals and harmonious groups harness the enthusiasm of their members to develop common interests, expertise and share the workload.

We consider it a weakness where the workload depends on only a few strong backs and hearts, or folks labour in isolation. For as all wise persons know even a will of iron may corrode over years of neglect.

To ensure that we have a growing and thriving principality to hand to our successors, it is our intention to work with our seneschals to develop a plan for the next five years to double the participation in the Principalityâ€™s activities. Our aim is to commence an organised continuity of growth that we can hand to our successors. This means not only bringing in new people, but supporting the existing and future activities in a manner that will let them thrive.

This means that we will need warriors of all flavours, armourers, marshals, archery marshals, bowyers, fletchers, cooks, brewers and all manner of other artisans.

We must stress here that it is our command that our populace do not to work themselves beyond their capacity and burn themselves out, but work collectively to harness their skills teach newcomers and allow the sum of their efforts to go far beyond what can be achieved alone.

We are early in this path. By the end of our reign this path will have only just begun. We hope you will join us with joyous hearts and open minds and that we all will grow together in numbers and spirit.

Yours in Service

Alexander & Agnes

Principes Insulae Draconis
