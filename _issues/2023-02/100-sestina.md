In late October I was dispatched to the Court of Nordmark on a diplomatic mission from the Coronet
of Insulae Draconis. Through dangerous lands and bitter snow-driven plains I journeyed to deliver
the words of Insulae Draconis to their Highnesses Nordmark. Here are those words and the reply
from Nordmark below.

“Unto the beautiful and deadly Jovi Torstensdottir, and the mighty and joyous Stigot Eke af
Haapsalu, do Their Celestial Highnesses, Euphrosyne and Ranulf, send our greetings.
How’s it going, bro and sis? We wish we could be there, but you know how it is trying to keep
all these nobles adequately oppressed. We barely have a minute to relax!

Since we can’t be there in person, we thought you might enjoy some news from our side of
the kingdom. First of all, it’s been as hot as the Sahara over here. Despite that, we’ve had
some very exciting internal wars and skirmishes, which tells us that our populace still has too
much leisure time and could be paying more of their feudal duties. Do you have any advice
for improving the iron fist of our rule? We look forward to your top tips for tyrants!
Second, we don’t know if you’ve heard, but it turns out there is an entire other Kingdom to
the west of us. For some reason, the people who live there are pretty confused about
geography, because they keep calling themselves the Kingdom of the East. They are
definitely missing a quality Drachenwald education.

At any rate, it seems like they didn’t appreciate Dread King Avery’s annual tax-collecting visit
this year, and as the western bulwark of Drachenwald, we have to stay here and shoo away
their occasional raiding parties. Nothing we can’t handle, but it is very annoying.
So, we thought it would be great fun to go over the ocean next year and give them a right
proper Drachenwald Strength. We’re going to be bringing our best warriors to Pennsic 50
next year, and we hope to see you there. Everything is more fun when our siblings from
Nordmark are around!

If nothing else, we can teach them that they need to fix their maps, because Drachenwald is
the centre of the universe.

Anyways, great chat, we miss you!

Love,  
Your bro and sis,  
Ranulf and Euphrosyne  
P.S. Send more Black Death.”

Having delivered these words, I awaited a reply, and swift as a thunderclap Princess Jovi stood and
fixed me with a piercing gaze. In an instant she composed this reply, which I later discovered to be a
sestina in the form of Arnout Daniel’s poems and in a 13th century style. Such is the mighty Jovi.
