Unto the populace of Insulae Draconis do Euphrosyne &amp; Ranulf send peace and warm
greetings.

The time is rapidly approaching for us to retire from our role as the Celestial Highnesses of
Insulae Draconis.

It has been an honour to serve both Principality and populace, and it is our deepest hope
that in the past nine months we have been able to encourage and inspire you to achieve
your goals and dreams in the SCA.

We know in our hearts that whichever couple (out of 14!) grasps victory on the field at
Coronet Tournament, the Principality has a prosperous future. We know this because each
of these couples will make fantastic royals, and because the future of the Principality is
written by you, its populace.

We look forward to travelling into that future together, with you.

In faith and trust,  
Ranulf &amp; Euphrosyne  
Prince &amp; Princess of Insulae Draconis
