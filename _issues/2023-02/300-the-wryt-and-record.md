### Agreements between the Caryque and Huckvale Families - 1584

Mundane matters prevented me from getting articles out for the last couple of issues. However, in the mean time one exciting thing did happen. Whilst I didn’t reach the storied heights of my friend, fellow-Flintheathian and skilled writer Lady Rebecca, I can now describe the Writ and Record as a Master William Blackfox Award Nominee, which is still pretty cool.

To make up for the previous missing articles I’m going to cover two related documents this time, both related to the marriage settlement in my previous article. The delay has had one advantage however, in that it gave me time to secure permission from the Oxford Family History Centre to include photographic copies of the originals of the relevant Huckvale Papers in my Baelfyr articles. So this time you get to see the originals too (and get to pull me up on any mistakes).

Both agreements date from November 1584 and involve members of the Caryque (Carrick) family along with John Huckvale and his son Cuthbert. The first is a Final Concord from Richard Caryque which survives in two copies, in essence identical, although they differ in the words per line and a small number of abbreviations. The second is a Bond from Henry Caryque. I haven’t investigated the Caryque family, but it would seem likely as a first assumption that Richard and Henry were brothers. The Caryques would also have been  cousins of a distant sort as John’s grandfather, Robert Huckvale, was married to Elinor sister of an earlier Richard Carricke.

The Final Concord, the older agreement by two days and entirely in Latin, whilst couched in terms of gifts, is the sale of a substantial agricultural holding to the Huckvales for the sum of 130 silver marks (£86⅔), a mark being worth two thirds of a pound or 13s 4d. A pound (or livre) was not a physical amount of money as we know it, but appeared only in accounting. According to the National Archives this equates to about £17,730 in 2017, and was equivalent to about 10 horses or 46 cows. This seems like a low price for 280 acres of land along with four properties. Indeed it sounds like a good sized farm with the accommodation for four labourers and their families, much the same size as the one on which I grew up. At today’s prices, that would buy somewhere between 1 and 1½ acres in the same county of Oxfordshire. Very cheap!

However, the National Archives also says that the price was equivalent to nearly 5 years of wages for a skilled tradesman. This would equate to a salary of about £3,730. Skilled trades have changed over the centuries, but a 2017 survey placed the median wage of electricians and plumbers at about £30,000, which conveniently is about ten times higher than in 1580. So what would have cost nearly five years of pay at the time, would now cost about half a year today at an equivalent price, although in modern terms £150,000 would buy about 10 acres. It would seem that even though wages were much lower, so was the relative value of land and property, at least if we assume that the sale was at a fair market price. It’s also worth bearing in mind that the Cotswolds and environs are one of the most expensive places to buy any kind of proper currently.

The second agreement is a bond, with a Latin header section followed by a larger section in English. and in modern terms is a sub-let. Henry Caryque held the messuages and land under copyhold for the term of his life, and for £100 turned over this right to the Huckvales, but still only for the term of his life. I don’t know how old Henry was at this time, but this was clearly something of a gamble. Henry could have keeled over rapidly instead of living a long life. It was common for such copyhold agreements to cover the natural lives of three named, related people, often covering two generations. It is quite possible that Henry was the disinterested last survivor of such a threesome, but the original agreement would need to be checked to be sure.

Unfortunately, the bond doesn’t specify exactly what was leased, presumably judging the reference to the original copyhold to be sufficient. IT does however sound on the same scale as the previous document, although without further research it is not possible to say whether larger or smaller. What is notable, however, is that the Huckvales were willing to pay more for this time limited grant than they did for the outright purchase of land above. It may be that being in possession and using the land (Henry was apparently resident in Middlesex) put them in a good position to secure the copyhold when Henry died.

Given that the agreements are dated within two days of each other, it seems unlikely that they were arrived at independently. Perhaps there was some advantage to biasing the payments towards one. The relative value of land and between different types of agreement is certainly something I need to investigate further, as two examples give rise to plentiful speculation, but no real conclusion.

My Latin is somewhat munitions grade, not unlike many of the writers of the time, so I may well have mangled my ending where I have expanded abbreviations.
