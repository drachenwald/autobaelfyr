Greetings all,

Our isles are truly spoiled for choice when it comes to events just now.

Dun in Mara and their friends ran a wonderful Spring Crown last month. Congratulations to William and Isabetta, the new heirs of Drachenwald, and thank you to the event team and everyone else who volunteered to make the event a success.

May opens with Flaming Arrow, in the same site in Glen Rathlin, and also sees two of our favourite camping events: St. Bede's Fair in Flintheath, and Strawberry Raid in Dun in Mara.

It's wonderful to see all this activity, and I hope that everyone reading this gets to participate in one of them. Until next month!
