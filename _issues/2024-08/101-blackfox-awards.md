The William Blackfox awards are a prestigious, society-wide award recognising excellence in newsletters and websites. The AS 57 results have been announced, and Insulae Draconis has been remarkably well represented among them.

The Best Article award was won by "Embroidered Book Covers", authored by Mary Verch Thomas. This article appeared in the May 2022 issue of the Baelfyr. Congratulations to Mary, who will receive a certificate and Master William Blackfox token.

The Baelfyr itself, under the stewardship of my predecessor Lucrezia-Isabella di Freccia, received a commendation in the category of Best Overall Newsletter.

"The Writ and Record", by Nycholas Eystleech, likewise received a commendation in the category of Best Overall Feature.

Another article from the May 2022 issue, "Public and Private Faces of the Italian
Condottiere II", by Alessandra di Riario d’Aretino, was nominated in the category of Best Poetry or Short Fiction.

Outside of the Baelfyr, I would like to mention the nomination for Best Written Contribution to a Kingdom Newsletter of Alessandra de Riario, Henric vanden Casteele, Svetoslav Sokolov, and Guy de Dinan for “Practical Drachenwald: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Panel” in the August 2022 issue of the Dragon's Tale.

And finally, it's my pleasure to report that the Annals of Eplaheimr, under the editorship of Susannah of York, was nominated by the Kingdom Chronicler for an honourable mention.

Congratulations to all the receipients of nominations, commendations and awards. Insulae Draconis has a truly superb and long standing record of newsletter contributions, and I am delighted to see it recognised across the society.

In service,  
Chronicler
