### Gwerful an Filí and Mícheál Breathnach 

[Mícheál]  
Twenty years! Can you believe it?  
This land has endured and flourished.

You’ve suffered the great plague, cared for by Zoe & Avery. At present you luxuriate in the arms of the gentle and benevolent Eularia and Alexandre, second of their names.

Are you not content?

Sometimes the weather is pleasant, bright, and sweet.

Sometimes a novel wind blows, brisk and biting, and well, circumstances change.

[Gwerful]  
An apple seed requires the bitter bite of chill nights to crystalise its destiny. Allow it to burst forth fresh to productive life. Tales from far lands tell of plants born only when their seeds are unleashed by the fierce fever of fires that then proceed to cleanse the ground of what preceded. Soon, it will be time, to put shoulders to wheels, dirty hands, and make bold moves.

[Mícheál]  
We need our archers for defence.  
Our fighters in steel and stick to present our authority.  
Our artisans to display the magnificence of the kingdom  
and all to demonstrate our resplendence and might to the terrifying world beyond.

This will not be effortless. Work will be difficult; Demanding toil through harsh winter and the deluge of summer, to achieve our revelation.

It is a sacrifice we are willing to make…

I, Mícheál Dubh, and the Dread poet Gwerful, will preside over this grand march to greatness.

Fighters! I have crossed weapons with all of you before.

I will not hold back.  
We will have victory today, only if you give it to us.  
Fight to the very limit of your skill and ability.  
You stand between this principality and the incandescent rule that we will reign upon it.

Muhahahahaha muahahahah!

### Gabrielle of Dun in Mara and Erin Volya

Now Come Erin and Gabrielle.

Erin - Glaive Wielder  
Gabrielle - Swift Speaker  
Erin - Justice Seeker  
Gabrielle - Fairhanded

Both far travelled  
Both rightful Throne claimants
