Greetings all,

We have just completed another reporting cycle and news from all parts of the Principality are showing progress and optimism for this year. Our numbers burgeon, with 268 paid memberships. Can we break 300 this year? I certainly hope so.

Please do consider obtaining membership of our club, the cost of keeping insurance going, as well as several behind the scenes funds and support is not going down any time soon, and the fees are excellent value for money: [https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk](https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk)

Couronne de Caldicot in August - the planning team is expanding and would like to highlight that bookings will open on March 1st. Get your armour ready! Hoist those banners high, we're storming a castle! Will your group be able to take the Oxford Roll this year? Bring on those tabards!

There is a swathe of events on the calendar now, and I am looking forward to meeting friends old and new over the next few months, so where will the SCA take you next? [https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar/](https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar/)

Fancy building your own event? Got an idea or a cool venue? Check out our event support advice in the Principality library: [https://insulaedraconis.org/library/](https://insulaedraconis.org/library/)

Last but not least - Seven months until I step down and I am still looking for a successor.

All the best  
Guy
