I have people to thank this month. Thank you to Deputy Chronicler meldun, who prepared most of this issue
while I was unwell. And thank you to you, the reader, for your patience in receiving this delayed issue.
Having a small team to work with, rather than all the responsibilites falling on one person, makes this
already enjoyable duty feel light.

On that subject, my term ends in autumn of this year. Joining a team does not mean that you must implicitly
accept the role of successor. If you have ever thought about how you might
like to do something different with the Baelfyr â€“ let's talk. Drop me a note at
[chronicler@insulaedraconis.org](mailto:chronicler@insulaedraconis.org).

In service,  
Sela
