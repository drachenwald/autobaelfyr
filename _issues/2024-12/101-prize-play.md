Unto the Academy of Defence of the Kingdom of Drachenwald, our Sovereign Rulers
of the same, and all nobles and attendants of their court, do I Baron Nicholas
de Estleche dictus le Tardif, Prefect of the said Academy, Companian of the
Silver Guard and the Fox &c, send greetings.

I hereby make known my intent to sponsor Hlǣfdige Rebeeca Stormwiga of Flinthǣþ,
Holegncwēn Gēolġebēorscipes, Provost of the Academy to play her prize for the
rank of Prefect of the Acedemy at St.Bede's Fair to be held at Bourn in the
county of Flinthǣþ on the final weekend of May next.

May those who would stand as examiner make themselves known unto. Let all who
would test her as she holds the field assemble at the appointed place and at the
appointed time. Let all who would witness her skill and prowess gather likewise.

Let those who would face her pray for a clear sky, for should the storm
accompany her, Rebecca shall lay low those who stand against her as wheat in the
field, and wrest the trees from the soil so that nothing shall stand above her.

Writ this eleventh day of December anno scoietatis 59 at Utbech



In service,

Nicholas de Estleche
