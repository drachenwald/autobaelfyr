As I sit with a soothing cup of tea, I find myself reflecting over all of the Arts and Science achievements that I have been privileged to witness during 2023.  I think each of us can be truly proud of ourselves and in what we have accomplished.  


Some of us, like Milord Geroge here, seen wearing his new cloak (and yes, they are indeed carrots decorating the edge of his cloak) have tried out new things..  Many of us have diligently worked on and improved their crafts.  One such SCA noble springs readily to mind, and his exquisite work can be viewed here at  [Richard of Salesberie, Scribe and Illuminator](https://richardofsalesberie.blogspot.com/).   Whilst others (holds up hand here) have thoroughly enjoyed themselves dibbling and dabbling in an eclectic squadrillion of activities that the SCA and Insulae Draconis has on offer, albeit (in my case) with varying degrees of success.  However, we cannot sit back and become complacent. There is still  much left to achieve.


## Highlights of 2023

I am quite sure that each of us will have settled upon our favourite highlight or indeed highlights from 2023.   I will confess to having a fair few of my own.  One of my most favourite memories is what I like to recall as the ‘Feast of Flags’ from the Michaelmas event held  6th - 8th October at Linnet Clough Scout Camp.  Led by the esteemed Lady Amy of Oscrossgold, the populace responded with overwhelming generosity to the call for Shire Banners, Personnel Flags and well anything that could be used to decorate the main hall.   It was a true feast for the eyes, don’t you think?

## Looking forward to 2024

### Minister of Arts and Science - OFFICERS FOR THE SHIRES

The role undertaken by a Shire Minister and Arts and Science Officer, and their deputies is going to be vital in moving Insulae Draconis Arts & Science to the ‘next level’ for 2024.

So what exactly does a Shire MOAS Officer actually do?  They love creating things, all sorts, they love watching other people creating things, all sorts, and most importantly of all…. They share what they have seen with  me, once every three months.  Not terribly onerous at all is it?  Especially if you can send me pictures of the wondrous creations.


And then, what do I actually ‘do’ with all this information?  Two things - the first thing is I share all this information proudly with the Kingdom of Drachenwald MOAS (the KMOAS) and secondly - well, I have a cunning plan which is in the Development Planning Stage.  Watch this space. More details coming soon.


So if you are wanting to get more involved in your Shire and this is something of interest - do talk with your Shire principal first.   I am quite sure they will be delighted to hear from you.

 

### ‘Feast of Flags’ - Part II

A second project I can share with you at this time -  is ‘Feast of Flags - Part II’



I know that many of you were unable to participate in this original initiative.  Do NOT despair.  I have undertaken to co-ordinate  ‘Feast of Flags’ - Part II.  Thus we hope that many more of you will be able to take part, by creating for yourselves your own flag or banner that may relate to yourself, your households and/or even your Shire.  These marvellous items can then be displayed at SCA events, decorate your camp and I might even add be used as backgrounds for virtual calls.  


There are many ways to make these flags and banners and over the coming months - helpful guides will be posted on both Discord and on Facebook.  Not sure you can make one by yourself?  Reach out to my office and let's see how we can help you.  Also - we have many talented artisans - you could also consider commissioning your flag or banner. 


### Principality Largesse

I am absolutely delighted to be able to share with you all a project that has become quite dear to my heart.  In 2024 the ID MOAS Office will begin working with their Highnesses to develop and co-ordinate the efforts of the ID populace with regard to Principality Largesse.  


If, like me, the concept of ‘largesse’ is shrouded in a fog of mystery, then I invite you to walk with me on this new and exciting adventure.  Together we will discover just what ‘largesse’ means, who can give ‘largesse’, what is involved and of course, who actually makes or gifts ‘largesse’.


For now though, it is time to sign off for 2023 and I leave you with this heartfelt message for the coming year:


ᛗᚨᛁ ᛁᛟᚢ ᚹᚨᛚᚲ ᛊᚨᚠᛖᛚᛁ ᚢᚾᛞᛖᚱ ᚦᛖ ᚹᛁᛜᛊ ᛟᚠ ᛁᛟᚢᚱ ᚷᛟᛞ
