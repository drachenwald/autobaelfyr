While I read quite a few Arab cooking books when I prepared for this feast I found one that had
everything I needed in it with the added advantage of having not only the translation of the recipes
modern recipes with measures and detailed instructions. The book is “Scherazade’s Feast” by Habeeb
Salloum, Muna Salloum and Leila Salloum Elias. It is a well researched book and mentions the respective
sources fro each recipe and has an extensive glossary that was very valuable for my endeavour. The
measures in the recipes below are measured for 60 people and quite sometimes I paraphrased the recipes
rather than copying them. If you use store bought ground spices you want to increase the stated amount
by quite a bit. Freshly ground quality spices are usually a better choice. I hope this helps at least some of
you as an introduction into the medieval Arabic cusine.
